# Docling Pipeline Implementation Progress

This document summarizes the progress made on implementing the docling document processing pipeline.

### 1. Project Analysis & Setup

- Analyzed the project structure and the `docling-pipeline-implementation.md` PRP.
- Confirmed no existing files violate the 500-line limit.
- Added `docling` to `requirements.txt` and installed all dependencies.
- Verified the existing test suite to ensure a stable baseline before starting modifications.

### 2. Core Logic Implementation

- **`core/output/writer.py`:** Created a new module to handle all file system writing operations, isolating I/O logic.
- **`core/pipeline.py`:** Created the initial skeleton for the main pipeline orchestrator, which will coordinate the document conversion process.

### 3. `docling` Adapter Refactoring (In Progress)

The main focus has been on refactoring `core/adapters/docling_adapter.py` to integrate the real `docling` library, replacing the previous mock implementation. This has been an iterative debugging process due to the complexities of the `docling` API.

- **Initial Refactoring:** Replaced the mock function with a direct call to `docling.document_converter.DocumentConverter`.
- **API Discovery:** Worked through several `ImportError` and `AttributeError` issues to identify the correct modules and class names for document elements (`SectionHeaderItem`, `TextItem`, `PictureItem`) and the correct method for iterating over document content (`document.iterate_items()`).
- **Current Status:** The adapter is now using the correct `docling` API calls. However, the test is failing because `document.iterate_items()` is not yielding any content from the sample DOCX file. The immediate next step is to diagnose this issue by inspecting the `docling` document object more closely.
